{"body":"![Cura logo](http://i.imgur.com/X2QlT.png)\r\n\r\nCura is a mobile phone application for the Android platform \r\n(Gingerbread 2.3.3 and above). It is a bundle of systems administration tools targeted mainly at sysadmins.\r\n\r\n[![Get it on Google Play](http://www.android.com/images/brand/get_it_on_play_logo_small.png)] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cura&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5jdXJhIl0.)\r\n\r\nWhen in the hands of a sysadmin, Cura will provide:\r\n\r\n1) A personalized Terminal emulator for direct interaction with said server.\r\n\r\n2) The Syslog reader that allows for reading logs directly from the server.\r\n\r\n3) A system monitor that visually graphs CPU and RAM usage percentages.\r\n\r\n4) Access to the port-scanning utility “Nmap”.\r\n\r\n5) Server Stats are general server information like its Vitals (hostname, last boot time, logged in users, etc..), Mounted Filesystems, Memory Information and Processes Status. The Processes Status section has a \"Kill Processes\" button inside (brings up a dialog listing of the most costly processes, selecting one of these will cause said process to be killed (given that the user has the needed privileges to do so)).\r\n\r\n6) Log-in monitoring with notifications (while you are logged in, you can get notifications about anyone else that also logged in to said server)\r\n\r\n5) Added to which, a security feature is implemented that allows you to have Cura's database wiped when you send the compromised phone a secret pattern of your choosing. (ex: send an SMS message containing \"phone has been stolen!\" to your Android phone to wipe Cura's database and receive the location of the compromised phone as an SMS to your emergency phone number or as an e-mail to your emergency e-mail address).\r\n\r\nCura is multi-lingual and for now, it supports English, German and Greek.\r\n\r\nMore information about Cura can be found here:\r\n* Very detailed [Wiki](https://github.com/Odaym/Cura/wiki)\r\n* [Cura on Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/p/cura)\r\n* [Cura on Freecode](http://freecode.com/projects/cura)","google":"","tagline":"Cura is a systems administration application for the Android platform","note":"Don't delete this file!
